# Small-A-or-B-Game
Just a small A or B game, with example.

[Demo](https://akosnikhazy.github.io/Small-A-or-B-Game/)

In the js folder you find the game.class.js and the controls.js. They are interacting with eachother to make the game. Its simple, I just randomly decided to make this as practice, feel free to use and modify it as you like. Please keep it in mind. I wrote this without any plan, on the fly, so it is not optimized in any way, and I do not plan to do it. It works, found no bugs, also there are plenty of solutions for a game like this. I just made it because why not.
